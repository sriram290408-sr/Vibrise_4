      <h2>About VibeRise</h2>
      <p>
        VibeRise is the worldâ€™s first vibrating pillow alarm, carefully designed 
        to wake you up gently without using loud sounds. Unlike traditional alarms 
        that can be stressful and disturbing, VibeRise ensures a peaceful start 
        to your day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This product is <strong>completely safe and non-harmful</strong>. It uses 
        soft vibrations inside the pillow that are harmless to your health, while 
        still being effective enough to wake you on time.
      </p>
      <p>
        VibeRise is also <strong>the first of its kind in the market</strong>, 
        created after months of innovation to combine comfort, technology, and 
        practicality. It is perfect for students, professionals, and anyone who 
        values a calm and healthy lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
        With VibeRise, you donâ€™t just buy a pillowâ€”you invest in 
        <em>better mornings, better health, and better productivity</em>.
